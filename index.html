                    People lack motivation to work out so we are designing an app where you collect points in order to motivate the user to work out

                   My group chose to target fitness activites we thought would be physically challenging but appealing to individuals who rarely excercise. We placed an emphasis on group sports, we believe the path to an active lifestlye is more easily navigated with peers. We believe a focus on group-orientated workouts will help us reach our goal of impacting whole communitites at once. We stratigized some user rewards that can be obtained through a competitve points system, as well as highlighting the mulitple phsyical and mental benefits of leading a healthy lifestyle.
